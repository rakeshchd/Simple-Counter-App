# Simple Counter App

This is a simple React application that demonstrates a basic counter functionality. The app allows you to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value with the click of buttons.

## How It Works

- The counter value is displayed prominently in the center of the app.
- You can increment the counter by clicking the "+" button.
  - The "+" button is disabled when the counter reaches the maximum value of 10 to prevent further incrementing.
- You can decrement the counter by clicking the "-" button.
  - The "-" button is disabled when the counter reaches the minimum value of 0 to prevent further decrementing.
- You can reset the counter to 0 by clicking the "Reset" button.
  - The "Reset" button is disabled when the counter is already at 0.

## Technologies Used

- React: The app is built using the React library, which provides a component-based architecture for building user interfaces.
- useState Hook: React's `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the counter.
- Bootstrap: Bootstrap is used for basic styling, including button styles and layout.
